<h2><a name="rankings page"> Rankings Page</a></h2>

  After clicking on the second button from left to right, the user is redirected to a page that shows a few rankings and two graphs.
</p>
<p>
  There will be 5 lists of rankings, that are each scrollable since they are a top of the first 50 subreddits. The tops are made using the criteria shown above and the values represent the number of either subscribers, posts, comments, upvotes or awards. 
</p>
<p>
  Right below the tops, the user can see 2 bar charts that are a visual representation of two rankings, after posts and after comments.

<h2><a name="subreddit page"> Subreddit Page</a></h2>

<p>
  On the right side of the name of the subreddit the user can press a bell icon to subscribe and unsubscribe to it. If subscribed, the bell is coloured bright orange, else its a faded shade of orange. After subscribing, the list of subreddits can be found on the Settings Page.
</p>
<p>
  Each subreddit will show a number of data in the sections that include the ranking based on the number of subscribers, posts, comments, upvotes, awards, all listed before per subscriber, new subscribers, new posts per day. 
</p>
<p>
  The user can hover over the "i" symbol next to the Ranking name to see the exact amount of either subscribers, or posts, or the type listed below Ranking name.
</p>
<p>
  After checking all the statistics regarding rank, the user is able to see the top posts from the last hour, the last day or from all the time.
</p>
<p>
  Below them there are two graphs, a bar chart and a pie chart. The bar chart represents the number of comments among the first 26 reddit posts on the subreddit section hot. The pie chart was made calculating how many of 26 posts have which upvote percentage.
